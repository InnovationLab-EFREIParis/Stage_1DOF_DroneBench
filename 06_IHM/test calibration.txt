*This file is an example of the kind of data file you would use with the 'Calibration Mode' from the GUI of the Drone Bench project*
*Please follow the instructions below, if you want to do the simulation correctly*

# First and foremost, we invite you to take into consideration that the data that will be used for the simulation, must be entered this way:

N1	N2

# N1 and N2 are numbers (you must strictly use integers) and they must be separated by a tabulation.
# Be sure not to add any spaces before, between or after the numbers or the line won't be understood as a correct line.
# Do not add any comments on the line, or it will be considered as incorrect.
